# Minecraft Aternos Discord Bot

## Project Description

This project aims to create a Discord bot that monitors an Aternos account to check which Minecraft servers are online. The bot will provide real-time updates and notifications to a Discord channel, making it easy for community members to know when a server is available for play.

---

## Project Outline

### 1. **Bot Setup**

- Create a new Discord bot application and obtain a bot token.
- Set up the development environment (Node.js/Python, dependencies, etc.).

### 2. **Aternos Account Integration**

- Research and implement a method for programmatically checking server status via Aternos.
- Securely store Aternos account credentials.

### 3. **Server Monitoring**

- Periodically check the status of Minecraft servers linked to the Aternos account.
- Handle authentication and session management with Aternos.

### 4. **Discord Integration**

- Implement Discord bot commands (e.g., check server status, list servers).
- Configure the bot to send notifications to specific channels when servers go online/offline.

### 5. **Error Handling & Logging**

- Log all bot activities and errors.
- Handle possible failures (Aternos downtime, Discord API errors).

### 6. **Deployment**

- Host the bot (local machine, cloud, or server).
- Set up process managers (e.g., PM2, Docker) for reliability.

### 7. **Future Features**

- Add support for multiple Aternos accounts.
- Provide server start/stop controls from Discord (if possible).
- Implement uptime statistics and advanced notifications.
